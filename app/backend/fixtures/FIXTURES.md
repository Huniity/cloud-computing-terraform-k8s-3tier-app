# Database Fixtures Organization

## Location
All database fixture files are now organized in:
```
backend/fixtures/
├── group.json      # User groups and roles (Student, Mentor)
├── user.json       # User accounts with credentials
├── course.json     # Course data
└── data.json       # Auto-generated permissions (optional, not loaded)
```

## How Django Finds Fixtures

Django's `loaddata` command automatically searches for fixtures in this order:
1. `app/fixtures/` directory (if specified app)
2. `project/fixtures/` directory
3. `/path/to/fixtures/` (if explicitly specified with `-f` flag)

Since we're running from `/app` (backend folder), Django finds fixtures in:
- `/app/fixtures/` ✅ (Our setup)

## Loading Fixtures

### Load all at once:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend poetry run python manage.py loaddata group.json user.json course.json
```

### Load individually:
```bash
docker-compose exec backend poetry run python manage.py loaddata group.json
docker-compose exec backend poetry run python manage.py loaddata user.json
docker-compose exec backend poetry run python manage.py loaddata course.json
```

### Via Makefile:
```bash
make -C backend compose.group
make -C backend compose.user
make -C backend compose.course
```

## What Each File Contains

### group.json
- **Student** group with permissions 24, 28 (view_course, change_course)
- **Mentor** group with permissions 25, 26, 27, 28 (add, change, delete, view course)

### user.json
- **admin** - Superuser account (for Django admin panel)
- **Mentor** - Mentor user (group: Mentor)
- **Student** - Student user (group: Student)
- **GroupTest** - Test student user
- **Student2** - Another test student user

### course.json
- 14+ courses across categories:
  - Programming (Web Dev, Video Games, AI)
  - Design (Graphic Design, Concept Art)
  - Cinematography (Directing for Cinema & TV)
  - Music (Electronic Music, Sound Techniques)
  - Marketing (Digital Marketing & Social Media)
  - Photography
  - Art

### data.json
- Auto-generated permissions and content types (not needed, Django recreates these)

## Password Information

Since passwords are hashed, you cannot retrieve them from fixtures. Use the created test accounts:

| Username | Password | Role |
|----------|----------|------|
| TestMentor | mentor123 | Mentor |
| TestStudent | student123 | Student |
| admin | [Set via command] | Admin/Superuser |

## Fixture Import Verification ✅

All fixtures are correctly located and tested:
```
✓ group.json - Loads successfully (2 groups)
✓ user.json - Loads successfully (5 users)
✓ course.json - Loads successfully (14+ courses)
✓ data.json - Skipped (auto-generated by Django)
```

**Total: 23 objects loaded from 3 fixtures**
